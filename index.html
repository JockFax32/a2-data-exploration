    <h1>World Rank of Colleges</h1>
    <p> Below is a visualization which measures the overall score of a university against three metrics which are used to compose this score. 
        The data was retrieved from the Times Higher Education organization. To learn more about how each metric was generated please visit their website.

        <h2>World College Metric Evaluations</h2>
        <div id="vis"></div>
        <div>
            <p> The provided visualization allows a user to see the relationship between a university's overall score and a specific metric
                 that is used to compute that score.  As such, the graph helps illuminate the weight of each of these metrics. For example, 
                 if a university has a low total score but a high research score, then the user can infer that not much weight is placed on
                  the university's research score  when generating the total score. To encode the data, I choose to use position on a common 
                  scale (e.g. the overall score) with a scatter plot. To further express the data, I created a tool tip so that when a user 
                  hovers their mouse over a data point, they see the name and rank of the university. I choose a scatter plot rather than a 
                  bar chart to allow users to see a trends within the data set (e.g the higher the individual metric score the higher the overall score)</p>
            <p> To increase the effectiveness of the visualization I broke up the data into regions based on the location of the university. As such the 
                user can see how the scores change between each region as well as the density of schools in each region. With this selector a user may 
                infer that there is bias to European and North American schools, since there are very few schools in other regions. Users may also select
                 the year in which the data was collected. This will allow the user to see how the data changes, or remains constant, over the three year 
                 period. Again they may infer that with a low variance between these scores that there is a certain bias for the more prestigious schools 
                 (i.e Oxford and Harvard)  to continue to place in the top ten ranking. Final, the user may select which metric they wish to compare against 
                 the total score. As previously mentioned the user can see how each metric is weighted in the composite metric, total score. </p>
